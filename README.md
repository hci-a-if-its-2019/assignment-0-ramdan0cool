## Assignment 0: Examples of bad designs
### 1. Internet Explorer
**Brief Description:** \
Internet Explorer is an internet browser released in 1995, discontinued but maintained today. 

### 2. Fanfiction.net
**Brief Description:** \
Fanfiction.net is a website spesifically for fan fictions of many media, from books, to video games, to movies. Users can read many fan fictions of their choosing, or pick a random choice. The website has a forum and a community of their own. Users who complete the free registration can create and publish their own stories, maintain profile, and comment/review other stories.

**Personal Opinion:** \
For a website spesifically for archiving stories, this website is a good one. That is it. Not much can be said for this website. The design of this website is highly arguable, from artistic point of view, the design provide a simple and clean UI, and makes the users comfortable. Yet not many people feel this design interesting, and most of the time, only those who love to read may feel attracted to this website. Others, not so much.

**Problems:**
1. Very simple UI.
2. Design does not change for a long time.
3. Since monitor is an object not easily moved, reading many paragraph may lead to slight injuries.
4. First time writers may have a difficulty trying to publish their stories.


### 3. Reddit.com
